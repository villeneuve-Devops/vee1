Procrastination is a thief of your wealth. Work smart, do a project everyday. That's how you become better. Remeber: if you can't fly, run. If you can't run, walk. If you can't walk, crawl. At least do not linger in the same position. God be if you.
Continue to work hard no matter what.
The sun will shine on you and you will smile
Work on real projects
